Mr. Liu focuses on the use of the density functional theory (DFT) to determine the energetics of catalyzed reaction pathways. He is using the calculated energetics to develop microkinetic and kinetic Monte Carlo models to understand the catalyst state and unravel dominant reaction mechanisms during plasma-assisted catalysis.
